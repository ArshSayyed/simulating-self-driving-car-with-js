# How it Works
Our self-driving car is equipped with ray-casting sensors that allow it to sense the environment and traffic around it to drive efficently. The neural network, which is a complex set of algorithms, takes in data from the car's sensors and uses it to make decisions about speed, direction, and other factors. The genetic algorithm works in tandem with the neural network to optimize the car's performance by constantly adjusting its parameters and structure to improve its decision-making ability.

# Visualization Tool
We've also created a visualization tool that lets you see how the neural network is learning in real-time. You can watch as the car makes decisions and see how the neural network's parameters change with each iteration.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository and run the simulation in your preferred programming environment. Our simulation is written in JavaSript and uses no library
